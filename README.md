# bootstrap-flexbox
Sass project to join bootstrap 3 and flexbox

## Motivation

The finaly to build this small library is that in some projects I use bootstrap because I love it, but I love too flexbox, because is so easy to use and give to me a lot of tricks for build complex blocks very fast. I see some libraries that do the same that this library, but this library not change the grid system of bootstrap creating new clases for the flexbox grid, this library replace the grid system of bootstrap for flexbox using the same clases. 

I added some clases to update the core of bootstrap for new displays right now you have (col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg and col-xl).

## Installation

### First:
```
bower install bootstrap-box --save
```

### Second:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/bower_components/bootstrap-box/dist/core.min.css">
```

### Finaly:
Enjoy using it
